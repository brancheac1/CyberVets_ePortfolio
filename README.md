# Welcome to my CyberVets ePortfolio!
Greetings! My name is Aurelia C. Branch'e, and I am currently participating in an internship with the CyberVets Cybersecurity Program. I am a Sergeant Major in the Maryland Army National Guard. My experience is plans, operations, training, budget, and aircraft maintenance. I hold an MBA, a Baccalaureate Degree in Business Administration, and an Associate Degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am in the process of transitioning out of the military and into Cybersecurity. This ePortfolio  gives an observation of my process. The CyberVets program is a 180-day cybersecurity internship run through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) revolving around training prior military members for cybersecurity careers upon their transition.

## My Projects
The [Projects](https://github.com/brancheac1?tab=projects&type=beta) are divided into 3 categories:
* [Courses, Certifications, and Badges](https://github.com/users/brancheac1/projects/2) - This is where you will find any Cybersecurity courses, certifications, and badges that I have completed. AS I get further into the program, I may add a section of courses I intend on completing. 
* [CyberVets Program Progress](https://github.com/users/brancheac1/projects/1) - This section consists of my daily journals/ notes on what I did that day and my CyberVet prgression.
* [Escalate Challenge Logs](https://github.com/users/brancheac1/projects/3) - Escalate is a training platform CyberVets utilize for all kinds of cybersecurity training activities in challenges using a Linux Virtual Machine and numerous different softwares and programs to complete a variety of cybersecurity challanges. Here you can find detailed information on every challenge I have attempted or completed along with hopefully all of the step by step approaches to each challenge, any and all notes or thoughts while doing the challenge, and wrapping things up with the skills and knowledge I learned through the challenge.
