## My Projects
The [Projects](https://github.com/SamuelMc24/CyberVets-ePortfolio/projects?type=beta) are divided in 3 categories:
* [Courses, Certifications, and Badges](https://github.com/users/SamuelMc24/projects/3) - This will be my Cybersecurity progress board where you can view all of my completed courses and certifications, as well as courses and certifications I am planning to complete in the future. Here you will also see any other seminars or classes intend on taking that I deemed noteworthy enough to log here in my accomplishements page. 
* [CyberVets Program Progress](https://github.com/users/SamuelMc24/projects/2) - This section is where you can view all of my notes on my CyberVets program journey with daily journals on what I did that day, including activities, main topic takeaways, and learning progress as a whole. I will continue to update this daily with new information on the activities I am completing and the new skills I am adding to my arsenal.
* [Escalate Challenge Logs](https://github.com/users/SamuelMc24/projects/1) - Escalate is a training platform CyberVets utilizes for all kinds of cybersecurity training activities in challenges using a Linux Virtual Machine and numerous different softwares and programs to complete a variety of cybersecurity challanges. Here you an find my logs on every challenge I have attempted and hopefully completed along with all the step by step approach to the challenge, any and all notes or thoughts while doing the challenge, and wrapping things up with the skills and knowledge I learned through the challenge.
