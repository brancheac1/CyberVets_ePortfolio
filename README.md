# Welcome to my CyberVets ePortfolio!
Greetings! My name is Aurelia C. Branch'e, and I am currently participating in an internship with the CyberVets Cybersecurity Program. I am a Sergeant Major in the Maryland Army National Guard. My experience is plans, operations, training, budget, and aircraft maintenance. I hold an MBA, a Baccalaureate Degree in BUsiness Administration, and an Associate Degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am in the process of transitioning out of the military and into Cybersecurity. This ePortfolio  gives an observation of my process. The CyberVets program is a 180-day cybersecurity internship run through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) revolving around training prior military members for cybersecurity careers upon their transition.
